# Socket.IO-Usage-Demo-Android
Using socket.io library for realtime socket connection on Android app.

Source code in this demonstrates using Socket.IO library for real time socket connections if we don't want to write our own code.

(If you want to implement own socket code, check my IOT-Raspberry-Pi-Android-App repository.)

Directly take the class from this repo and just concentrate on data handling. Connections code is already written in TestActivity.java.
